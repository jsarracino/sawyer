     *  Returns a time point that has a fully specified time (year, month, day, hour, minute, and second) such that it is the
     *  earliest time that is past the time specified by this time point.  For instance, if this time point is fully specified
     *  as "2022-06-30 11:30:00" then the return value is the next second, namely "2022-06-30 11:30:01". If this time point is
     *  partially specified as "2022-06-30 11:30" then the return value is the next minute, namely "2022-06-30 11:31:00".
     *
     *  If this time point has no date, then the return value also has no date, in which case it's possible for the return
     *  value to be earlier than the input value. For instance, if this time point is the last second of the day "23:59:59",
     *  then the return value will be the first second of the (next) day: "00:00:00". Similarly, a partially specified last
     *  minute of a day gets converted to the first minute of the next day, "23:59" to "00:00:00".
     *
     *  If the return value would have a year that's larger 9999, then an error is returned. For instance, the upper bound for
     *  "9999-12-31" is "10000-01-01 00:00:00", which exceeds what can be represented by ISO 8601.
