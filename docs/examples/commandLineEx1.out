Name
       commandLineEx1 - disassembles files one address at a time

Synopsis
       commandLineEx1 [switches] specimen_name

Description
       This program is a very simple disassembler that tries to disassemble an
       instruction at each address of the specimen file.

Options
       The following switches are recognized by all tools in this package.

       --help; -h; -?
           Show this documentation.

       --version; -V
           Show version number.

       The following switches are specific to this command.

       --alignment align
           Alignment for instructions.  The default is 1 (no alignment).
           Values larger than one will cause each candidate address to be
           rounded up to the next multiple of align.  If this rounding up
           causes addresses after a valid instruction to be skipped then a
           warning is printed. No warning is printed if the alignment skips
           addresses after a disassembly failure.

       --at virtual-address
           The first byte of the file is mapped at the specified virtual-
           address, which defaults to 0.

       --isa architecture
           Instruction set architecture. Specify "list" to see a list of
           possible ISAs.
